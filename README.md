# Results plots

This repository produces the plots in the Results section of the thesis report.
There are three files:
* `draw_configuration_plots.py` - plots the configuration plots for the validation rollout trajectory
* `draw_task_space_renders.py` - generates the videos of the validation rolllouts (for presentation)
* `draw_end_effector_plots.py` - plots the end-effector position and orientation against the ground-truth

The `results` folder is where the plots and videos are saved. The `data` folder holds the data featured in the plots.
